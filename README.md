thanks @benawad for the fun site and project. https://github.com/benawad/stripcode
you need to put a github personal acess token in .env, get one at https://github.com/settings/tokens

this branch is for indexing all the correct answer, and after with another account selecting them, that how i got first.
> i still got the js file to get all the answer, but not the one to complete them because my dumbass git reset --hard it (lost multiple hour of coding), through it's relatively easy to rewrite if you want.

one of the other bot competitor passed me, so i had to rewrite my script, which is now pratically full proof from my experience with it.
now the index.js not just select the answer, but also when it got false at a response because the BD in incomplete, it had the new question to another DB. each run it reinforce itself.

also it's not ready to use as is for anyone, you'll have to changes some things in the code
